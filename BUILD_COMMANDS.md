### Manual Commands (if using Node.js 20 directly)

If you've already switched to Node.js 20 (`nvm use 20.18.1`), you can run:

```bash
# Local development
npm start

# iOS builds
eas build --platform ios --profile development
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Android builds  
eas build --platform android --profile development
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Submit to stores
eas submit --platform ios
eas submit --platform android
```

## ðŸ“± Build Process Overview

1. **First Time Setup**
   - Run `init-eas.bat` to initialize EAS project (one time only)
   - Ensure all credentials are configured in `eas.json`

2. **Development Testing**
   - Use `start-expo.bat` for local testing with Expo Go
   - Build development versions for device testing

3. **Production Release**
   - Build production version
   - Test thoroughly on real devices
   - Submit to app stores

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Node.js Version Issues
- All `.bat` scripts automatically switch to Node.js 20
- If manual commands fail, ensure you're using Node.js 20:
  ```bash
  nvm use 20.18.1
  node --version  # Should show v20.18.1
  ```

### Build Failures
- Check that all environment variables are set in `.env`
- Verify credentials in `eas.json` are correct
- Ensure you're logged in to EAS: `eas whoami`

### iOS Specific
- Requires Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- App Store Connect app must be created
- Provisioning profiles managed automatically by EAS

### Android Specific
- Google Play Console account required for store submission ($25 one-time)
- APK for development, AAB for production
