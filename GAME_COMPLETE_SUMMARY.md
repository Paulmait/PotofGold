2. **Upgrade** → Buy better carts with coins/gems
3. **Unlock** → Access new items and abilities
4. **Master** → Complete collections and achievements
5. **Compete** → Climb leaderboards

### **Scoring System**

```
- Common items: 1-10 points
- Rare items: 10-50 points
- Legendary items: 100-500 points
- Cosmic items: 1000+ points
