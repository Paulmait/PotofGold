# ðŸ”§ Fixing the Blank Page Issue

## Problem Identified
Your Pot of Gold game is showing a blank page at https://pofgold.com/ because:
1. The React app isn't initializing properly
2. Possible environment variable issues
3. CSP (Content Security Policy) might be blocking scripts

## Quick Fixes Applied

### âœ… Fixed Path Issues
- Corrected backslash paths in index.html to forward slashes
- Created fix script: `scripts/fix-web-build.js`

### âœ… Added Fallback Firebase Config
- Updated `firebase/firebase.ts` with fallback values
- This ensures the app works even if env vars aren't set

### âœ… Updated Security Headers
- Modified CSP in `vercel.json` to allow your domain
- Removed `upgrade-insecure-requests` which can cause issues

### âœ… Created Test Pages
- `/simple.html` - Simple working game demo
- `/test.html` - Debug page
- `/debug-web.html` - Diagnostic page

## Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Check the Simple Demo
Visit: https://pofgold.com/simple.html
- This should show a working mini-game
- If this works, the server is fine

### 2. Check Browser Console
1. Open https://pofgold.com/
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Check Console tab for errors
4. Common errors:
   - "Cannot read property of undefined" - React initialization issue
   - "Firebase is not defined" - Environment variable issue
   - "Refused to execute script" - CSP blocking

## Root Cause & Solution

### The Main Issue
The Expo web build is creating a complex React bundle that's failing to initialize. This is likely because:
1. Environment variables aren't being injected properly during build
2. The bundle is too large (1.83MB) and timing out
3. Dependencies like Sentry are causing issues in web

### Permanent Solution

#### Option 1: Rebuild with Environment Variables
```bash
# Set environment variables locally
export EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-key"
export EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-domain"
# ... set all variables

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Deploy
vercel --prod --yes
```

#### Option 2: Use a Simpler Build (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vite for faster, smaller builds
npm install -D vite @vitejs/plugin-react

# Create vite.config.js
# Build with Vite instead of Webpack
npm run build:vite

# Deploy
vercel --prod --yes
```

#### Option 3: Debug Current Build
1. Add console.logs to App.tsx:
```javascript
console.log('App.tsx loading...');
console.log('Firebase config:', process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY);
```

2. Rebuild and check console output

## Vercel Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel Dashboard:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`

## Working Alternative

While you fix the main app, you can use the simple version:
- https://pofgold.com/simple.html

This proves:
- âœ… Your domain works
- âœ… Vercel deployment works
- âœ… Basic JavaScript works
- âœ… The issue is with the React/Expo bundle

## Next Steps

1. **Check Vercel Logs**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Check Functions tab for errors
   - Check Build logs

2. **Simplify the Build**
   - Remove unnecessary dependencies
   - Disable Sentry for web
   - Use code splitting

3. **Test Locally First**
   ```bash
   npx serve web-build
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   # If it works locally but not on Vercel, it's an env var issue
   ```

## Emergency Workaround

If you need the game live immediately, use the simple version:
1. Rename `simple.html` to `index.html`
2. Deploy: `vercel --prod --yes`
3. This gives you a working game while you fix the full version

**Status**: The infrastructure is working âœ… but the React app needs debugging ðŸ”§
