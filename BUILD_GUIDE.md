## Building for Physical Devices

### Prerequisites
1. Install EAS CLI globally:

   ```

2. Create an Expo account:
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

3. Configure your project:
   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```

### Firebase Configuration
Before building, update the Firebase configuration in `firebase/firebase.ts`:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

### Sentry Configuration
Update the Sentry DSN in `services/crashReporting.ts`:

```javascript
const SENTRY_DSN = 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN_HERE';
```

## Building APK for Android

### Development Build (with Expo Dev Client)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

### Preview Build (Standalone APK)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### Production Build (AAB for Google Play)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

## Building for iOS

### Development Build
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

### Preview Build (Ad Hoc)
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

### Production Build (App Store)
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

## Testing on Physical Device

### Android
1. After build completes, download the APK from the Expo dashboard
2. Transfer APK to your device via:
   - Email
   - Google Drive
   - USB cable
   - QR code from EAS build page
3. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in device settings
4. Install and run the APK

### iOS
1. For development/preview builds, register device UDID:
   ```bash
   eas device:create
   ```
2. Download the IPA file
3. Install via:
   - TestFlight (production builds)
   - Ad Hoc distribution (preview builds)
   - Xcode (development builds)

## Environment Variables

The app uses different configurations based on the build profile:

- **Development**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV=development`
- **Preview**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV=preview`
- **Production**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV=production`

## App Store Submission

### Google Play Store
1. Build production AAB:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile production
   ```
2. Configure submit settings in `eas.json`
3. Submit to Play Store:
   ```bash
   eas submit --platform android
   ```

### Apple App Store
1. Build production IPA:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```
2. Configure App Store Connect settings
3. Submit to App Store:
   ```bash
   eas submit --platform ios
   ```

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] Authentication flow works (signup, login, forgot password)
- [ ] Game saves and loads progress correctly
- [ ] Admin panel functions properly
- [ ] Crash reporting captures errors
- [ ] Performance is acceptable on low-end devices
- [ ] All UI components render correctly
- [ ] Sound and haptics work as expected
- [ ] In-app purchases are configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Offline mode works correctly

## Monitoring

### Crash Reports
Monitor crashes and errors at your Sentry dashboard:
- Real-time error tracking
- Performance metrics
- User session replays

### Analytics
Track user engagement and game metrics through:
- Firebase Analytics (if configured)
- Custom game events in Sentry

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Clear cache: `npx expo start --clear`
- Update EAS CLI: `npm install -g eas-cli@latest`

### App Crashes on Launch
- Check Firebase configuration is correct
- Verify all required permissions are granted
- Review crash reports in Sentry

### Authentication Issues
- Verify Firebase Auth is enabled
- Check network connectivity
- Review offline sync queue

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check EAS Build logs in Expo dashboard
- Review Sentry error reports
- Check Firebase console for auth/database issues

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Firebase Project**
   - Create Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Create Firestore database
   - Add Android/iOS apps with correct bundle IDs

2. **Set up Sentry**
   - Create project at https://sentry.io
   - Get DSN for React Native
   - Configure source maps for better debugging

3. **Configure EAS Project**
   - Link to Expo account: `eas init`
   - Set project ID in app.json

4. **Build and Test**
   - Start with preview build for testing
   - Test all features thoroughly
   - Monitor crash reports and performance

5. **Prepare for Store Release**
   - Create app store listings
   - Prepare screenshots and descriptions
   - Set up in-app purchases (if needed)
   - Submit for review

## Important Notes

- The app currently uses placeholder Firebase config - must be updated before building
- Sentry DSN needs to be configured for crash reporting to work
- Admin users must be manually added to Firebase 'admins' collection
- EAS project ID must be set in app.json before building
